Hello! Our project for Pupper is Pupper Soccer. The code for the project is located in final_project, and just requires `./run.sh` to run the necessary code. The only dependency besides ROS2 and whatever was downloaded for the previous labs is 'just_playback', which can be installed with `pip install just_playback`.
